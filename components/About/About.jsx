        <p class="about-sub-heading my-2">
          My name is Zeyad Attala. I believe that success in medicine is not about talent alone; it is about strategy, discipline, and the right guidance.
        </p>
        <p class="about-sub-heading my-2">
          As a medical intern at Cairo University Hospitals and a graduate of Newgiza University, I finished first in my class while balancing clinical responsibilities, research, and exam preparation. Along the way, I aced the USMLE exams with a score of 271 (96th percentile), proving that the right system can make even the most challenging goals achievable.

        </p>
        <p class="about-sub-heading my-2">
         To further strengthen my clinical and academic foundation, I completed four months of U.S. clinical experience across three different states in internal medicine subspecialties. This exposure gave me a first-hand perspective on how international graduates can adapt and thrive in diverse healthcare environments.

        </p>
        <p class="about-sub-heading my-2">
         Now, I share these lessons through mentorship and advisorship, helping medical students and IMGs build efficient study systems, excel in exams, and strategically shape their medical journey.
